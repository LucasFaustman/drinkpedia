## Drinkpedia Project

## Assumptions and translations functionality explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6e3i-5HX1A&ab_channel=LucasFaustman

## Demo Site: https://lucas-drinkpedia.netlify.app/

## Assumptions

1. I assumed using Bootstrap for styling is fine.
2. Using React/Vite/Bootstrap/Vanilla JS would be fine for this project.

## Optimizations

1. Find a free translation API so I can plug it into my existing translation logic. Currently, the translation functionality is commented out.
2. Add testing to make sure the two APIs being called work as intended.
3. Add the ability for users to favourite their favourite drinks
4. Add additional information about each drink(Maybe history, nutritional information, etc.)

## Solution formulation

Steps when building: 

1. Setup the React app using Vite.
2. Decided to create a fun cocktail app.
3. Fetched the data from the API and displayed it on the page
4. Added error handling/loading states for a better user experience.
5. Used Bootstrap in order to make it look nice and usable on mobile.
6. Implemented translation functionality.
